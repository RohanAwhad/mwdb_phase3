Task 2: Implement a program which,

  - for each unique label l, computes the correspending c most significant clusters associated with the even numbered Caltec101 images (using DBScan algorithm); the resulting clusters should be visualized both
    * as differently colored point clouds in a 2-dimensional MDS space, and
    * as groups of image thumbnails. and 
  - for the odd numbered images, predicts the most likely labels using the c label-specific clusters.

The system should also output per-label precision, recall, and F1-score values as well as output an overall accuracy value.
